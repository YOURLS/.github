| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security issues are a special case.
If you find a security hole in a YOURLS project, disclosing it to the public with opening an issue is not the ideal.

Make 100% sure it is a security hole (same process as bug reports) but instead of opening an issue, send an email to yourls@yourls.org.

<!-- Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc. -->
